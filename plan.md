**Clarifying scope for application spec**

The user's request is quite detailed, and I'm trying to narrow it down. They're asking for a spec with unit-tested components and a testing roadmap, which sounds like an application plan. But wait—what's the context for "the application"? Given the previous file upload, it seems like the request might refer to a specific project discussed earlier. However, the uploaded transcript isn't about the app design but some unrelated discussion. I’ll need to clarify the context before moving forward.

**Seeking context for application spec**

The user asks for a detailed spec for an "application," but I'm unsure which one. The uploaded file seems unrelated—just a workshop transcript. This could be about a variety of options: the interactive chat platform described, perhaps related to Koii or even the web-based game "The Bananas Game." However, neither is explicitly mentioned. I need clarity on the specific application the user wants a spec for, as the conversation context doesn't make it obvious yet.


Thought for 7 seconds


Below is a proposed **Product Specification** and **Roadmap** for the interactive multi-agent chat-bot platform described in your “Product Specification Workshop.txt” transcript. It breaks the system into well-scoped, unit-testable components, and lays out a sequence (with parallel tracks) for building and testing each piece.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

At a high level, the system consists of:

1. **Personality Data Manager**
   Stores and version-controls each “disciple”’s personality profile, dialogue prompts, and fine-tuning datasets.

2. **Chatbot Engine Adapter**
   Wraps a large-language model (e.g. OpenAI / local LLM), exposing a clean interface for generating agent responses.

3. **Conversation Orchestrator**
   Routes incoming user messages to one or more agents, and mediates multi-agent dialogues.

4. **API Layer**
   A REST/GraphQL façade that the front-end and external bots use to interact with the Orchestrator.

5. **Front-End UI**
   React (Next.js) application for the Last Supper scene: renders avatars, handles user input, displays multi-agent chat.

6. **Agent Deployment Service**
   Dockerized containers deployed across the Koii network (or other compute swarm) to scale horizontal inference.

7. **Admin & Analytics Panel**
   Web dashboard for uploading/editing personalities, monitoring traffic, viewing logs and conversation metrics.

8. **CI/CD & Testing Harness**
   Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying each component.

> **Note on Unit Testing:**
> Each component lives in its own repo or mono-repo folder, with its own test suite (e.g. Jest for JS, PyTest for Python). Aim for ≥80% coverage on all critical logic.

## 3. Roadmap & Testing Sequence

Below is a high-level six-week plan. Items in **bold** can be developed and tested in parallel tracks.

| Phase                       | Weeks | Tasks                                                                                                                  | Parallel Tracks                 |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **0**                       | 0–1   | – Project setup: repos, CI config, coding standards documentation.                                                     | – CI/CD setup                   |

| **1**                       | 1–2   | – **Define Data Model & Schema** for Personality profiles. <br>– **Front-End UI Skeleton** (static Last Supper scene). | – Personality Data Manager      |
| – Front-End UI              |       |                                                                                                                        |                                 |

| – API Layer                 |       |                                                                                                                        |                                 |
| **3**                       | 3–4   | – **Conversation Orchestrator** core logic with mock data. <br>– Begin **Admin Panel** CRUD pages.                     | – Orchestrator                  |
| – Admin Panel               |       |                                                                                                                        |                                 |
| **4**                       | 4–5   | – Wire Front-End → API → Orchestrator end-to-end (mock profiles). <br>– Extend Personality Manager with validation.    | – Front-End integration         |
| – Data Manager enhancements |       |                                                                                                                        |                                 |
| **5**                       | 5–6   | – Swap in real LLM backends, deploy **Agent Containers** to test cluster. <br>– Add logging/metrics.                   | – Engine Adapter real LLM       |
| – Deployment & Monitoring   |       |                                                                                                                        |                                 |
| **6**                       | 6+    | – User acceptance testing, performance tuning. <br>– Final polish: animations, error flows, autoscaling rules.         | All teams converge for final QA |

* **Sequential dependencies:**

  1. Data Model → API → Orchestrator → Front-End wiring → Full integration
  2. Chatbot Adapter must exist before real-LLM tests
  3. Orchestrator must be in place before multi-agent demos

* **Parallelizable tracks:**

  * **Data Manager**, **Admin Panel**, and **Front-End UI Skeleton** can start immediately once CI is configured.
  * **Engine Adapter** and **API Layer** can be built side-by-side in Phase 2.
  * **Agent Deployment** and **Logging/Monitoring** can run concurrently once core logic is stable.

### Next Steps

1. Review component boundaries & interfaces.
2. Spin up skeleton repos and CI pipelines (Phase 0).
3. Kick off parallel tasks in Phases 1–2.

Let me know if you’d like me to adjust scope, add time estimates, or drill down into any specific component!
